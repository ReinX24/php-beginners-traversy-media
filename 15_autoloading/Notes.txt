# Creating a composer.json file for autoloading
To create a composer.json file, install composer and type the following in the
terminal:
compose init

After creating the composer.json file, add the following under the require
statement:
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "app\\": "./app"
    }
  }

This means that all the classes within the app directory will be autoloaded. To
do this, we must run the following command in the terminal:
composer update

This creates the vendor folder which will be autoloaded to files where 
autoloading is executed.
